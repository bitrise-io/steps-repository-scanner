This folder contains the `frameit` setup of the Mac OS X screenshots.

Take a look at the `Framefile.json`:

- All screenshots except the last one use the same `offset` information
- The last screenshot is a full screen screenshot taking up the full space of the Mac
- The title height is used to properly center the title

More information on the [frameit](https://github.com/fastlane/frameit) project page.
